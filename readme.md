# DNA-PPG: A Foundation Model for Photoplethysmography via Dual Neighborhood Alignment

> **Note:** This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the paper **"DNA-PPG: A Foundation Model for Photoplethysmography via Dual Neighborhood Alignment"** submitted to **IJCAI 2026**.

## 🚀 Introduction

**DNA-PPG** is a novel pre-training framework designed to learn robust and universal representations for Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. It addresses the limitations of existing physiological foundation models—specifically the manifold distortion caused by rigid hard-negative sampling and the precision loss from coarse discretization.

Our framework introduces **Dual Neighborhood Alignment**:
1.  **Morphology-Aware Self-Supervised Branch (Morph-SSL):** Uses Time-Frequency Soft Weighting (TF-Soft) to capture universal signal dynamics.
2.  **Physiological Semantic Alignment Branch (Phys-Align):** Projects physiological indicators into a continuous semantic space to embed precise physiological priors.

Pre-trained on **10.7 million PPG segments** from over 8,400 subjects, DNA-PPG achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream regression and classification tasks.

```

## 📊 Data Preparation

Due to privacy regulations and licensing agreements, we cannot provide the raw datasets directly. Please request access from the official sources:

### Pre-training Datasets

1. **VitalDB:** https://physionet.org/content/vitaldb/
2. **MESA:** https://sleepdata.org/datasets/mesa

After downloading, place the raw data in a local directory and run the specific preprocessing scripts to generate 10-second segments and align physiological labels:

```bash
# Preprocess VitalDB
python preProcessVital.py

# Preprocess MESA
python preProcessMesa.py
```

### Downstream Datasets

Refer to `dsPreProcess.py` for handling downstream datasets (PPG-BP, PPG-DaLiA, WESAD, etc.).

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Pre-training

To pre-train the DNA-PPG model using the Dual Neighborhood Alignment strategy (jointly optimizing $L_M$ and $L_P$):

```bash
python train.py --epoch 10 --model "resnet1d" --transform_ssl --transform_sup --use-tfc --data-source "all"
```

### 2. Downstream Evaluation

To fine-tune the pre-trained encoder on specific tasks:

```bash
python dsPreProcess.py
python -m downstream.parallel_executor
cd downstream/
python outcome_regression_all.py --model model_path
python outcome_classification_all.py --model model_path
```
